A simple plugin that allows users to choose their branded colors only for use in the TinyMCE editor. Set up your brand colors once and easily use them on every post or page..

== Description ==

Allows users to set up to three global brand colors to wrap their text with. Provides a TinyMCE button in the Visual editor to choose these colors quickly without using the colorpicker or entering a hex code on each page or post.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `bsc-brand-colors.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Appearance -> Set Text Colors to set up the plugin.
4. Use the three colorpicker fields to set your global brand colors. Optionally give each color a name.
5. In the post editor, select the text you would like to color. Click on the paintbrush icon in the editor toolbar and select a brand color to wrap the text.
6. To clear a color, select the colored text, click on the paintbrush icon and choose "Clear color".

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
